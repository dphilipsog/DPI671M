  <p class = "lead">
  My first job after graduating college, was as a public policy analyst for the National Institute for Transparency in Mexico. Specifically, I was recruited to address in policies regarding facilitating access to public information. At that time, the Institute was also undergoing a massive structural reform that dramatically expanded its jurisdiction from the federal level to the national level, meaning that it was now responsible for supervising and guaranteeing public information access at the federal and state level. 
  </p>

  <p class = "lead">
  In accordance to the 2015 structural reform, my office sought to implement a survey at a national level to quantify and understand the access to public information gaps between states and the federal government. Moreover, we partnered with graduate students from the Masters in Data Science at ITAM to develop a platform that condensed and visualized data on public information request trends and the demographic characteristics of those who submitted them. The main purpose of this was to have an evidence-based diagnosis of transparency at a national level in Mexico.
  </p>

  <p class = "lead">
  Unlike the other departments within the Institute, my office was comprised of young professionals with similar policy backgrounds. The partnership with Data Science graduate students also fostered a specific culture with a focus on innovation and an agile framework. Together, we were able to coordinate and sketch out a web platform that would compile millions of observations on public information requests over the past decade. Nonetheless, access to most of the data required permission from the IT Department. 
  </p>

  <p class = "lead">
  In addition to guarding access to the Institute’s historical data, the IT Department was also in charge of developing a platform - the National Transparency Platform - that would allow users to create and submit public information requests. This project overlapped with our own because it was the main source through which data on user demographics would be collected. Nonetheless, the two platforms had two different goals - ours’ to make a diagnosis and the IT department’s to provide a public service. 
  </p>

  <p class = "lead">
  Both platforms; hence, followed two distinct models. One was based on procurement and recruiting outside talent, and the other required using inhouse services housed under the IT department. By being able to participate in this process and having to coordinate with IT in order to avoid overlaps and get access to data, I was able to compare and contrast the implications and outcomes of both models. While my office mostly coordinated with students in order to have a pilot we could improve and build on, the IT department avoided cooperating with other departments and had a fixed date for the release of their final product. 
  </p>

  <p class = "lead">
  Six months after working on this project, I was offered a job elsewhere and left the Institute. When I left, my office’s project was already in its first-stage and gathered thousands of observations on cyclical patterns between electoral years and public information requests. On the other hand, the IT’s project was kept secret until May 6th, 2016 when it was released to the public.  
  </p>

  <p class = "lead">
  The public’s reaction to the National Transparency Platform was disastrous. A day after it was published, 19 civil society organizations formed a coalition and published a decalogue of demands. Among these were the need to present the platform’s information in a logic and simple format, improve front-end design, use an API that can download past requests, and adhere to open source standards as well as further transparency on any procurement processes. In addition to these concerns, civil society demanded accountability of the 19 million pesos (3 million USD) spent on the project. Not but least, at the time of the release, the project I had collaborated on had been shut down to lack of access to the data. In 2017, a year after the National Transparency Platform was first published, the Institute continued to receive terrible press and over 650 technical support requests were reported.  
  </p>

  <p class = "lead">
  After I learned the outcomes of both platforms, I was not surprised. Still, I felt a lot of frustration for my team’s wasted efforts and the impotence of having forecasted the National Transparency Platform’s imminent failure. Now, in retrospective, I consider the Institute had good intentions towards technology and innovation. Nonetheless, I consider it lacked the political will to reorganize its’ structure and create change. 
  </p>

  <p class = "lead">
  A possible explanation on why there was a lack of political will was that after the 2015 reform, the Institute was highly politicized and many political parties were allowed to indirectly appoint councilmembers. Furthermore, the IT department was part of the larger structure that did not allow for any flexibility or change. Long-term contacts, slow obsolete procurement processes and corrupt tenders were also a significant obstacles for change.
