  <p class = "lead"> In my last post, I discussed the Mexican Congress’ digital shortcomings and its lack of transparency due to insufficient access to public information such as legislator’s assistance to sessions and plenary votes. Furthermore, the organizational structure for the current IT Department is decentralized and bureaucratic, making it increasingly inefficient. A particularly troubling issue is that each parliamentary fraction provides their own IT services in addition to the chambers’ respective services.</p>  

 <p class = "lead"> Congress is arguably the cornerstone of the democratic process as the institution in charge of guaranteeing efficiency and transparency to represent their nation’s people accordingly. As such, it is indispensable that the Mexican Congress addresses its public responsibility to develop a digital strategy that puts legislation within the reach of its population and empowers them to become active members of the process by which it is drafted, voted, and implemented. In addition, Congress is obliged to abide by transparency standards. Inefficient access to public information is a violation of this obligation and international open data standards ought to be applied as a means to uphold basic democratic rights.</p> 

 <p class = "lead">A brief outline of next steps to enact technological change in the Mexican Congress is to:

    <ul class="nav navbar-nav">   
    <li><b>(1) Create a special committee with the support of the executive boards of both chambers</b></li>
    <li><b>(2) Build partnership with civil society</b></li>         
    <li><b>(3) Reform internal legislation on administrative procedures and parliamentary fraction budget allocation</b></li>               
    <li><b>(4) Draft a shared mission statement and include stakeholders as part of the process</li>
    <li>(5) Recruit talent</b></li>   
    </ul>
 
 <br> 
 <br>
 <p class = "lead"> In order to build sufficient capacity for technological change in the Mexican Congress, it is crucial to shift from a government-focused approach to a user-centric one by building partnerships with civil society organizations that have been leading digital innovation in Mexico thus far. Unlike the legislative branch, the Mexican executive developed a Digital Strategy Platform during the current administration. Throughout their process of change, the participation and constant involvement of civil society helped public officials understand the needs and preferences of their citizens and users. Thus, a good way to initiate change is by creating a joint special committee in both chambers tasked with holding town hall meetings and reaching out to experts on the democratization of technology and open government. Since this unit will be responsible for technological change within Federal Congress and taking into account the current lack of coordination, it makes more sense to create a centralized committee or commission to map out the current satelital IT teams and facilitate cooperation.</p> 

 <p class = "lead"> For change to be significant it is also advisable that the special commission have autonomy as well as significant top-level sponsorship. To achieve this, the special commission ought to have support from the Executive Boards of both chambers and political-backing from the speakers of both houses. This will make a significant difference when passing in-house legislation to modify budget allocation for IT displacement and reducing service overlap between the different IT departments. Political capital will be especially relevant to eliminate IT services within each parliamentary group and reduce their budgets accordingly. As such, part of the process must be to understand legislators’ and staffers’ needs in order to encourage their cooperation. To do so, it is important to work collaboratively along with the administration offices, human resources, and the specific parliamentary group offices.</p>  

 <p class = "lead"> Currently, the Mexican Legislative branch’s digitalization strategy aims to “enrich and manage the historical archives and legislative memories”. Hence, a shared and collaborative mission to advocate for transformational change ought to be drafted as part of internal legislation. This will also add credibility and legitimacy to coordination efforts. A mission statement should aim to transform the way the legislative process is implemented and designed by making it accessible to constituents and encouraging greater political participation through stronger links between democracy, technology and innovation.</p> 

 <p class = "lead"> Finally, another important and initial step to digitalize the Mexican Congress is to recruit talent. Since there has already been a significant push towards open government on behalf of the Presidency, the National Statistics and Geography Institute, and some state governments, it is possible to recruit talent with considerable experience bridging technology, innovation and government. Furthermore, it ought to be a priority to include members of civil society as advisers to optimize a user-centered focus and uphold digital rights. A multidisciplinary approach to comply with usability and back-end standards will also be used by attracting persons with various background in the public and private sector. To retain talent it will be important to have a dynamic service provision that continues to innovate and transform how democratic representation works.</p> 


 <p class = "lead"> To effectively promote a digital and democratic path for the Mexican Congress, it is first and foremost crucial to involve citizens and civil society as the primary stakeholders and to foment a user-centric strategy. Furthermore, to deal with potential step backs concerning political will and capital, it is strategically optimal to have top-level sponsorship on behalf of the highest offices within Congress - the executive boards and speakers of both chambers. Such a strategy will provide first steps towards a better, more transparent, and digital legislative branch.</p>
