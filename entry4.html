 <p class = "lead">The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) provides four different transportation services: subway, bus, commuter rail, and ferry. Since the MBTA’s failings during the winter of 2015, there was a wake-up call to address the lack of investment in service deliveries and technological development. Today, it is important to acknowledge the MBTA’s improvement. For example, accuracy regarding time estimates and delays has increased and is now able to provide a detailed minute count instead of categorical values. Nonetheless, significant challenges have yet to be addressed.</p>

 <p class = “lead”>First and foremost, the MBTA ought to have a comprehensive digital strategy that expands horizontally across the organization’s sectors and aligns efforts for guaranteed continued progress rather than one-time remedial actions. However, two important constraints are - cost-effectiveness and a customer-based design. At present, the T Digital Service seeks to undertake projects with 3 months duration to deliver and consequently iterate on improved services. This strategy, known as agile, has shown to be an effective solution for digital innovation that allows for greater flexibility and continuous improvement.</p> 

 <p class = “lead”>Partnership across departments is also a priority, facilitating in-house collaboration and overarching long-term goals. To maximize the potential and outcome quality of these projects it is also important to harness sufficient political capital to enact change. As such, the Digital Service ought to have authority mechanisms and high-level sponsorship to overlook its duties.</p>

 <p class = “lead”>Even though outsourcing is a practical solution to foster innovation and make up for lacking capacity, recruiting and retaining in-house talent are indispensable for a successful digital strategy. By drawing talent from diverse pools and backgrounds, T Digital Services allow for well-rounded solutions to different problems. Its partnership with IDEO is also beneficial by bringing outside talent to build on technological and software capacities. To attract in-house talent and retain it, the MBTA is also doing well by creating different posts based on full-time and temporary employees with competitive benefits and salaries that create an incentive scheme.</p> 

 <p class = “lead”>While full time rotation among existent MBTA employees enhances digital outreach within the organization, true change is better achieved through ongoing collaborative efforts with current employees. To maximize collaborative skills, it is best to consolidate long-term goals and share skills that target the specific needs of each department as a means to facilitate and complement their jobs. In addition to having horizontal and tailored digital accompaniment across the institution, it is also crucial for the digital strategy to have enough vertical authority to give orders and take recommendations seriously. </p>

 <p class = “lead”>In the MBTA’s Strategic Plan report, priorities include increased safety measures, improved customer attention, and meeting the needs of passengers of all abilities, among others. As such, an overarching solution for these problems is the collection and management of data. Data analysis allows for pattern recognition of customers and behaviors using current infrastructure without major investments. Hence, this measure also addresses the two conditions put forth by the MBTA - cost-effectiveness and a customer-based focus.</p>

 <p class = “lead”>A way to potentialize data is to go beyond blanket solutions with less impact, such as dashboards. Data collection should also be automatized using current infrastructure to construct metrics regarding capacity, congestion trends, optimal routes, delays, and costs. Such metrics could then be matched with demographic surveys to have a better assessment of how to improve customer service. </p>
