  <p class = "lead">The Mexican Congress at the Federal level is lacking an overall digital strategy that facilitates constituent’s access to important public information. It is particularly critical that the legislative branch does not provide easy access to users because of the high level of information and data it produces on a daily basis. From plenary votes to senator’s attendance, basic legislative data is often not accessible or does not follow an intuitive online paths for users. The Official Diary of the Federation (DOF) - which publishes all new legislation approved by the executive - is only available on PDF and only allows searches based on dates. If you do not know on what specific date a piece of legislation was published, it is almost impossible to find in the DOF. Furthermore, the format in which data is documented and published is not friendly and is not machine legible, hence, hindering in depth research and analysis.</p>

  <p class = "lead">On another note, Congress ought to make it’s information as transparent and accessible as possible simply because this increases legislator’s accountability towards their constituents. Hence, there is also a public duty to make government transparent. Improving access to votes, bills, and attendance in machine legible formats is a first approach in doing so. </p>

  <p class = "lead">The Mexican Congress is composed by a lower house - the Chamber of Deputies - and an upper house - the Senate. Each Chamber has separate digital platforms that are virtually disconnected except for a shared format. In addition, each Chamber has its own IT department that provide administrative and technological services to all 628 (500 deputies and 128 senators) and their staff. However, both Chambers are also divided by parliamentary factions that oversee other basic tasks, including IT services. These services differ to those offered by the chambers because they provide specialized treatment to legislators according to their parties’ budget, which is contingent on the number of seats held by each faction. Hence, IT is in the Mexican Congress is atomized into several independent departments that often overlap and increase the bureaucratic burdens. For example, legislators have two email accounts, one provided by their party’s IT department and the other by the chamber’s IT department.</p>

  <p class = "lead">A hypothesis on why there is a significant lack of digital innovation in the Mexican Congress is because of the convoluted in house budget management and resource allocation. Lack of political will is also a strong component since legislative transparency could easily backlash against deputies and senators. Finally, the administration executive directors have been around for many years, fostering an obsolete framework with little room for innovation.</p>

  <p class = "lead">A successful transformation would create a single digital service unit for the entire Congress with its own budget and eliminate the atomized IT departments. Furthermore, it would transition towards a user-based model rather than a government-based one. As such, the main objective of such a unit would be to facilitate the recollection, publication, and processing of all legislative activity and material. </p>
